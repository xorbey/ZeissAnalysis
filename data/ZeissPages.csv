1,"Fluorescence is the property of atoms and molecules, so called fluorophores, to absorb light at a particular wavelength and to subsequently emit light of longer wavelength. Fluorescence microscopy can be based on autofluorescence or the addition of fluorescent dyes.1,2 Under normal light fluorescent dyes might be invisible. But a surgical microscope with integrated fluorescence technology lights up the dye to visualize tumor tissue or blood vessels during surgery."
2,"The first use of intraoperative fluorescence imaging in surgery dates back to 1948 when surgeons used intravenous fluorescein to enhance intracranial neoplasms during neurosurgery.2,9 Since then, additional fluorescent agents have been used for a variety of surgical applications.4,5,6,9 Intraoperative fluorescence imaging offers the benefits of high contrast and sensitivity, absence of ionizing radiation, ease of use, safety, and high specificity.7,8,9 Compared with standard unaided vision using white light imaging, real-time fluorescence imaging is helpful in visualizing cancerous tissue and delineating tumor margins.8 Moreover, improved visualization of the cancer can reduce damage to important normal structures such as nerves, blood vessels, ureters, and bile ducts.9
In challenging microsurgery, surgical visualization adjuncts are essential for making the right decisions at the right time. The Intraoperative Fluorescence Technologies1 from ZEISS offer you the tools you need."

1,The X-ray source (XRS) with different applicator types creates a very focused radiation field. This leads to a targeted local high dose irradiation and enables increased tumor bed sterilization.1 A very low radiation scattering spares healthy structures and organs at risk from radiation reducing unwanted side-effects2 in contrary to conventional treatment workflows.

3,"The ZEISS INTRABEAM Spherical Applicator can be used for the intracavitary intraoperative delivery of radiation to the tumor bed, e.g. at the time of breast conserving surgery."
4,"The ZEISS INTRABEAM Needle Applicator can be used for the interstitial irradiation of tumors, e.g. in the treatment of vertebral metastases or brain tumors."
5,"The ZEISS INTRABEAM Flat Applicator can be used for the treatment of the tumor bed on surgically exposed surfaces, e.g. tumors of the gastrointestinal tract."
6,"The ZEISS INTRABEAM Surface Applicator can be used in the treatment of the tumor bed on the surface of the body, for example, irradiation of non-melanoma skin cancers."
7,"Immediate irradiation during surgery in the OR prevents tumor reformation stimulated by wound healing after resection3,4 and can lead to shorter overall treatments. This efficiently saves hospital time without compromising outcomes and lets patients benefit from a completed treatment while sleeping.5"
8,Post-operative treatment times of up to 6.5 weeks can be reduced to 3-5 weeks or even be eliminated for selected patients when adding IORT during breast-conserving surgery (BCS).2
9,ZEISS INTRABEAM devices have an extensive record of +250 peer-reviewed publications and +20 studies from over 30 countries confirming the clinical value of personalized and patient-centric IORT treatment options. This helps you to meet future clinical demands and secure reimbursements – a primary aspect of successful healthcare management in the future.

1,"Fluorescence is the property of atoms and molecules, so called fluorophores, to absorb light at a particular wavelength and to subsequently emit light of longer wavelength. Fluorescence microscopy can be based on autofluorescence or the addition of fluorescent dyes.1,2 Under normal light fluorescent dyes might be invisible. But a surgical microscope with integrated fluorescence technology lights up the dye to visualize tumor tissue or blood vessels during surgery."
2,"The first use of intraoperative fluorescence imaging in surgery dates back to 1948 when surgeons used intravenous fluorescein to enhance intracranial neoplasms during neurosurgery.2,9 Since then, additional fluorescent agents have been used for a variety of surgical applications.4,5,6,9 Intraoperative fluorescence imaging offers the benefits of high contrast and sensitivity, absence of ionizing radiation, ease of use, safety, and high specificity.7,8,9 Compared with standard unaided vision using white light imaging, real-time fluorescence imaging is helpful in visualizing cancerous tissue and delineating tumor margins.8 Moreover, improved visualization of the cancer can reduce damage to important normal structures such as nerves, blood vessels, ureters, and bile ducts.9
In challenging microsurgery, surgical visualization adjuncts are essential for making the right decisions at the right time. The Intraoperative Fluorescence Technologies1 from ZEISS offer you the tools you need."

1,The X-ray source (XRS) with different applicator types creates a very focused radiation field. This leads to a targeted local high dose irradiation and enables increased tumor bed sterilization.1 A very low radiation scattering spares healthy structures and organs at risk from radiation reducing unwanted side-effects2 in contrary to conventional treatment workflows.

3,"The ZEISS INTRABEAM Spherical Applicator can be used for the intracavitary intraoperative delivery of radiation to the tumor bed, e.g. at the time of breast conserving surgery."
4,"The ZEISS INTRABEAM Needle Applicator can be used for the interstitial irradiation of tumors, e.g. in the treatment of vertebral metastases or brain tumors."
5,"The ZEISS INTRABEAM Flat Applicator can be used for the treatment of the tumor bed on surgically exposed surfaces, e.g. tumors of the gastrointestinal tract."
6,"The ZEISS INTRABEAM Surface Applicator can be used in the treatment of the tumor bed on the surface of the body, for example, irradiation of non-melanoma skin cancers."
7,"Immediate irradiation during surgery in the OR prevents tumor reformation stimulated by wound healing after resection3,4 and can lead to shorter overall treatments. This efficiently saves hospital time without compromising outcomes and lets patients benefit from a completed treatment while sleeping.5"
8,Post-operative treatment times of up to 6.5 weeks can be reduced to 3-5 weeks or even be eliminated for selected patients when adding IORT during breast-conserving surgery (BCS).2
9,ZEISS INTRABEAM devices have an extensive record of +250 peer-reviewed publications and +20 studies from over 30 countries confirming the clinical value of personalized and patient-centric IORT treatment options. This helps you to meet future clinical demands and secure reimbursements – a primary aspect of successful healthcare management in the future.
